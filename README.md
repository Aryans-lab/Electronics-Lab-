# Electronics Laboratory – Computational Analysis

This repository contains **computational analysis and visualization** of selected electronics lab experiments from **Electronics Lab (P241)**.

The focus of this repository is **not circuit simulation**, but **post-experimental data analysis** used to:
- analyze measured data,
- fit physics-based models,
- extract parameters,
- and visualize results in a reproducible way.

Only those experiments are included **where coding added real analytical value**.

## What each coded experiment includes

Each experiment directory typically contains:
- **Raw experimental data** (CSV format)
- **Physics-based models**
- **Parameter estimation / curve fitting**
- **Clear visualizations (Bode plots, characteristics, transfer curves, etc.)**

All experiments follow a **consistent, modular structure** for reproducibility.

## Tools Used

- Python  
- NumPy  
- SciPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib

## Electronics Lab (P241) – Experiments Covered

### Experiments with Computational Analysis (included in this repository)

- Study of **RC Filter Circuits**
- Study of **LCR Circuits**
- **Transistor Characteristics**
- **Single Stage RC Coupled Amplifier**
- Study of **Basic OP-AMP Configurations and Simple Mathematical Operations**
- **Differentiation and Integration using Active Filter Circuits**  
  (OP-AMP IC 741)

> These experiments involve data fitting, frequency-response analysis, or parameter extraction and therefore benefit from computational treatment.

### Experiments Performed in Lab (not code-centric)

The following experiments were performed as part of **Electronics Lab (P241)** but are **not included here**, as they did not require or benefit from computational analysis:

- Introduction to Electronic Components  
- Study of **Full Wave Rectifier**  
- Study of **Boolean Logic Circuits** using digital ICs  
- Study of **Adder and Subtractor Circuits**  
- Study of **Flip-Flop Circuits**  
- Study of **Counter Circuits**

## Core of This Repository

This repository is designed to demonstrate:
- disciplined handling of experimental data,
- separation of data, models, and analysis,
- and reproducible scientific computation applied to electronics.
