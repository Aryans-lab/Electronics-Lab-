# Op-Amp Integrator and Differentiator using Active Filters (IC 741)

This experiment studies active first-order low-pass and high-pass filters
implemented using an operational amplifier (IC 741).

Interpretation:
- Low-pass filter → Integrator behavior
- High-pass filter → Differentiator behavior

Cutoff frequencies are extracted by fitting experimental Bode magnitude data
to first-order theoretical models.

All experimental data are stored in CSV format for reproducibility.

Tools: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
