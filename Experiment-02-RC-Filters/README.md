# RC Filters: Low-pass and High-pass

This experiment studies first-order RC low-pass and high-pass filters using
Bode magnitude and phase plots.

Cutoff frequency is extracted via nonlinear fitting to theoretical models.
All experimental data are stored in CSV format for reproducibility.

Tools: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas
