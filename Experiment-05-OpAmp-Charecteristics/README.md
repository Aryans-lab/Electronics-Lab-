# Basic Op-Amp Configurations and Mathematical Operations

This experiment studies:
- Inverting amplifier
- Non-inverting amplifier
- Basic Mathematical operations like Adder, subtractor and averaging
- Comparator (with and without threshold)

Linear regression is used to extract experimental gain values and
compare them with theoretical expectations.

All experimental data are stored in CSV format for reproducibility.

Tools: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
