# Single-Stage RC Coupled Amplifier

This experiment studies the frequency response of a single-stage RC coupled amplifier.

Key parameters extracted:
- Mid-band gain
- Lower cutoff frequency
- Upper cutoff frequency
- Bandwidth

The response is modeled using a standard low–high frequency roll-off model
and fitted to experimental data.

Tools: Python, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
